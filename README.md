## üî≠ Overview

This project showcases the power of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform to automate the deployment of a comprehensive Azure environment. It's designed with modularity, flexibility, and maintainability in mind, making it suitable for both learning and production use.

### Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Easily plug-and-play different components.
- **Scalability**: Effortlessly scale your infrastructure up or down.
- **Best Practices**: Implements Azure and Terraform best practices.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Includes networking, compute, storage, and database resources.

## üèó Architecture

The project is organized into several **reusable modules**, each responsible for a specific aspect of the infrastructure:

![Architecture Diagram](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Azure+Infrastructure+Architecture)

1. **Resource Group** (`rgroup`): Logical container for resources.
2. **Networking** (`network`): Sets up the virtual network infrastructure.
3. **Common Services** (`common`): Provisions shared services like logging and backups.
4. **Linux VMs** (`vmlinux`): Deploys Linux-based virtual machines.
5. **Windows VM** (`vmwindows`): Deploys a Windows Server instance.
6. **Data Disks** (`datadisk`): Attaches additional storage to VMs.
7. **Load Balancer** (`loadbalancer`): Distributes incoming traffic.
8. **Database** (`database`): Sets up a managed PostgreSQL instance.

## üõ† Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (v1.0.0+)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- An active [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## üöÄ Quickstart

Follow these steps to get your infrastructure up and running:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/azure-terraform-automation.git
   cd azure-terraform-automation
   ```

2. **Log in to Azure**:
   ```bash
   az login
   ```

3. **Initialize Terraform**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. **Review the execution plan**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. **Deploy the infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

6. **Clean up when you're done**:
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```
